## THE PACKAGE

See ../transport/README.md by S. Brambilla

The folder `src/` contains the **results contained in the PhD thesis 'Mixed-dimensional PDEs arising from
model reduction for multiscale modeling
of vascular transport'** by Laurino. In particular

- `src/results_adhesion/cinj_0_0_1` contains the results depicted in figures 6, 8, 9.

- `src/results_adhesion/cinj_0_1` contains the results depicted in figures 3. 10.

- `src/mesh_independence_tests` contains the results depicted in figure S1 of the supplementary material

- `src/other_results` (NOT PUBLISHED) contains the results obtained for different values of the pressure at the inlets and outlets of the network

- `src/utilities/secomb2mox` is a MATLAB file to convert the Secomb network in our format

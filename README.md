## THE PACKAGE

- #No_haematrocrit : contains the code for solving the nanoparticle transport and adhesion problem and the drugdelivery problem. The fluid dynamic problem is solved WITHOUT taking into account the effect of the haematoctit

- `Transport_3D1D_Coupling`     : The folder contains the code for solving the fluid problem and the mass transport (nanoparticle) with coupling terms (Simulations A and B of my master thesis)

- `Transport_3D1D_Drugdelivery` : The folder contains the code for solving the fluid problem and the mass transport (nanoparticle) without coupling terms, due to the presence of the drug delivery term (Simulation C of my master thesis)

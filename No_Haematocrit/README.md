## THE PACKAGE
- `Transport_3D1D_Coupling`     : The folder contains the code for solving the fluid problem and the mass transport (nanoparticle) with coupling terms (Simulations A and B of my master thesis)

- `Transport_3D1D_Drugdelivery` : The folder contains the code for solving the fluid problem and the mass transport (nanoparticle) without coupling terms, due to the presence of the drug delivery term (Simulation C of my master thesis)

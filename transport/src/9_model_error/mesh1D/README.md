In this folder, there are some pts files. 
They contain a single branch, from (-0.5, 0, 0) to (0.5, 0, 0).
They are discretized with a number of points equal to the number in the name of the file, +1 (e.g. segment160.pts has 161 points and 160 elements)

BEWARE: in the modeling error tests, they are used in bigger 3d domains: (-0.51, 0.51)x(-1,1)^2. In this way, we ensure that the branch is completely embedded in Omega.
